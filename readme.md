## Python projects
A general purpose repo for misc Python projects. 
These will be simple projects mostly build around Python3 on Windows

### Pomodoro
This is a blatant copy of https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-pomodoro-using-python-tkinter/
modified for my own personal 35/8 minute cycle and to add some comments about libraries.

### latest-xkcd
This downloads and displays the most recent xkcd comic.  
This was written using Bing or Google AI prompts (I forget which.)
Requires a running X-11 server, but amazingly it works on both Windows 10 and Linux.  
On Windows, rename to .pyx for console-less execution.
